Matrix Multiplication :
M[i,j] - M[i,k] + M[k+1,j] + pi-1pkpj - k is from i to j

Cutting the rod:
C[i] = Max (V[k] + c[i-k]) -  k is from 1 to i

Edit Distance:


Coin Change no of ways:

Coin Change get total coins:

Maximum continguous subsequence:
S[i,n] = S[i..j] [j+1...n]
S(i) = max(s(i-1) + A[i],A[i])
