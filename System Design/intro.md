Tools
-----------------

Cassandra - Wide Column highly scalable - eventual and strong Consistency
            gossiping

Mongodb - json , acid, scalable
mysql - master - slave
memcached/ redis - hold data in memory , key - value storage, highly scalable , cluster , distributed cache
zookeeper - leader election , scalable for reads , not for writes, in Memory
kafka - fault tolerant , Queue, pub Sub
nginx, ha proxy - load Balancer
solr , elastic search - highly avaialble , full text search
blob store - big picture , amazon s3
docker - containers
  kupernetes , mesos to manage containers

Hadoop / Spark - Map Reduce
HDFS  - distributed file system, fault tolerant
