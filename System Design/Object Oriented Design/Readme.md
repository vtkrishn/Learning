#OOPs concepts

###Object
	   representation of a class which has state, behavior, properties etc
     eg. Car, Apple etc

###Class
	   collection of objects and also can be a blue print for the object

###Inheritance
     Inherits all the beviour of the parent, IS A relationship
     eg. Dog is an inherited object from Animal

###Abstraction
	   Hiding interal details and showing the functionality alone
     eg. Phone call, we do not know how its interally working

###Encapsulation
	   Binding data together into single unit
     eg. Capsule contains different medicine bound together

###Polymorphism
	   One single task is performed in a different way
	   eg. Speaking. differt object speak differently, Cat speaks mew, dog speaks bark

### Realization
     its a relationship whenre if one object implements or executes other object
     single dotted line triangle
     eg. Car to wheel

###Dependancy
     connection between two components
     single dotted line representation with arrow

###Association
     relationship between two objects
     No ownership
     Strong Association (reference is present in Class A)
     Weak Association (one of the method takes class B)
     single line representation with arrow
     eg. Teacher and student

###Aggregation
     HAS A relationship , object exists even if we dont have the other object
     special for of Association
     there is an ownership
     Hollow diamond
     eg. Employee has an Address object

###Composition
     if one object contains another object
     if parent object deletes child also gets deleted
     Dark diamond
     eg. House and a room
     eg. Person - leg and hands

###Generalization
     reprresents two related classes considered specialized form of the super class
     A is a type of B
     single line with a triangle
     eg. Person - employee , manager

###Delegation
     reuse the composition with Inheritance
     object delegates to second object

#Multiplictiy
  * its an integer added to say how is the relationship
  * one to one
    * one person having one passport
  * one to many
    * one person can have many watches
  * many to one
    * Many children for one mother
  * many to many
    * Many Books can have Many Authors
