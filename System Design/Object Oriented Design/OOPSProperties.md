##Open Close Principle
* Software should be open for extension and close for modification

##Liskov Substitution Principle
* Object should be able to replace with their subtypes

##Interface Segregation Principle
* maximum decoupling and no clas should implement a method which does not use

* Details should depend on abstraction

##Design by contract
