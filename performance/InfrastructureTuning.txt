Operating System Tuning
Linux Tuning
  TCP IP timeout - less number increases performance, release closed connections
  File Descriptor - high is performance, change soft and hard limit
  connection queue size - increase
  ip port range - widen the range
  Time wait connection recycling - enable
  Reuse time wait connection - enable

Server Tuning
  Data source
    increase connection pool
    increase Thread pool
    enable Servlet caching
    enable HTTP transport persistent connections - keep-alive
    optimize result caching
    keep classpath short
    reduce logging
    increase server listen queues
    avoid reverse DNS lookups
    write time stamp instead of formatted dates
    avoid paging

JVM Tuning
increase JVM heap size
  -Xms minimum heap
  -Xmx limit after which it throws OutofMemory error
  -XXtlaSize - increase thread local area size

HTTP Tuning
  increase session timeout
  enable compression
    gzip, deflate

Database Tuning
  increase No of open cursors
  share cursor sharing
