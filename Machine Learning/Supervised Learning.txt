Supervised Learning

Ex, predict the house pricing
housing price prediction

x axis - square feet
Y axis  prices

right answers given with the datasets

Regression problems
Continuous learning - predicts with continuous output
ex. predict the sales for 3 months from 1000 identical items

classification problem
discrete value output
ex. datasets - tumor size - classify as malignant or benign
what is the probability malignant or benign if the tumor size is given
eg.classifying if the account of users is hacker or not

add age also as a parameter
no three or five features from which the machine learns.
infinite number or features/attributes to help computer learn more efficiently based on different attributes

Labelled data are supervised learning problem
