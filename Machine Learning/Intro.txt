Amazon, netflix recommender systems
Understanding human learning

What is Machine Learning?
ability learn without being explicitly programmed
Computer program learn experience E , task T, performance measures P
P increases based on E on T

Algorithms:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning

others: Reinforcement learning Recommender Systems
