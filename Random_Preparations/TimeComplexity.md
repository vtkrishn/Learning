#Constant Time - O(1)
Array lookup, Hashmap, any constant time operation like greater of two or three number

#Logarithmic Time - O(logn)
Binary search, looping with increment step with multiplication/division by constant
#O(loglogn) - increment is increased exponentially
i increments in sqrt() or pow()

#Linear Time - O(n)
looping from 1 to n, max number in array
recursive depth first search with visited node
Stack or Queue manipulation

#Linear Logarithmic Time - O(n*logn)
Quick sort, merge sort

#Quadratic Time - O(n*n)
matrix processing, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort
#O(n*k)
comparing two string of two lengths, hashmap with length n, and string with k length

#Cubic Time - O(n*n*n)

#polynomial Time - O(2^n)

#Factorial Time - O(n!)
factorial  of a number
-----------------------------
Space Complexity

Space needed to save the variables - O(1) for variables
hashmap or array storage is O(n)
