End to End Systems Design Knowledge:
  Translate requirements into an application design or system design
Systems Integration Knowledge/Ability:
  Experience and knowledge of integrating 3rd party software process, constraints, benefits, etc.
  Domain and System Integration [This will cover the designing integration between two systems: A & B for example.
  Discuss firewalls / proxys,
  failure recovery,
  large data loads,
  low latency requirements,
  security) -

Can you see the big picture - identify overall system design and different components that go into
Design and how they connect together to form a holistic system
● Ability to understand the business problem (identify the functional requirements)
● Ability intelligently discuss the design choices you are making
● Understanding of design methodologies to build a robust application
Discuss pro's and con’s (trade offs)
● Stay unbiased, don’t jump into absolute statements
● Provide support to your solution; justify your recommendation
● Always a good idea to sustain your recommendation with good points, good arguments
● Recommend we go with A ,because of B and C
● Emphasize list entities and attributes
● Preparation is key: refresh up on the entire data modeling process

How you approach integration with two systems: How do you get System “A” to talk with System “B”
○ Middleware
○ Interoperability
○ Protocols
○ Security
● How to build a robust integration system
● How to handle errors in integration
● How to handle concurrency

End-to-End Application / System Design:
● Ability to translate requirements into an application design or system design.
● The following are the qualities we should look for:
○ Data modeling, object modeling, design concepts for sharing data between multiple
systems
○ Architecture (messaging, api’s, tier systems design)
○ Security
○ Performance
○ Storage, including SQL & NoSQL

Demonstrates grasps on internal applications and integration points
● Everything that goes it on the frontend and backend
● Focus on customer satisfaction and user experience
