End-to-End Application / System Design:
● Ability to translate requirements into an application design or system design.
● The following are the qualities we should look for:
○ Data modeling, object modeling, design concepts for sharing data between multiple
systems
○ Architecture (messaging, api’s, tier systems design)
○ Security
○ Performance
○ Storage, including SQL & NoSQL

Demonstrates grasps on internal applications and integration points
● Everything that goes it on the frontend and backend
● Focus on customer satisfaction and user experience

Ask if they want you to focus on one component or another
● When asking clarifying questions - ensure you ask open ended questions to gather more info
● Who are our users?
● What are assets?
● What is the content that this application will be holding on?
● Where do we get that content?
● What time of information does the warehouse provide?
● Is there people employee data warehouse we can hook into?


Can you see the big picture - identify overall system design and different components that go into
Design and how they connect together to form a holistic system
● Ability to understand the business problem (identify the functional requirements)
● Ability intelligently discuss the design choices you are making
● Understanding of design methodologies to build a robust application
Discuss pro's and con’s (trade offs)
● Stay unbiased, don’t jump into absolute statements
● Provide support to your solution; justify your recommendation
● Always a good idea to sustain your recommendation with good points, good arguments
● Recommend we go with A ,because of B and C
● Emphasize list entities and attributes
● Preparation is key: refresh up on the entire data modeling process



How you approach integration with two systems: How do you get System “A” to talk with System “B”
○ Middleware
○ Interoperability
○ Protocols
○ Security
● How to build a robust integration system
● How to handle errors in integration
● How to handle concurrency

Demonstrate experience with and understanding of current/past employers’ business
processes
● Demonstrate experience with and knowledge of the functionality of third party systems
● Capability to understand new business processes/problems and identify the requirements for
which you would build an application
● Pick a solution design you previously completed. Describe the overall business process it was
a part of, the specific functionality of your solution, and how it fits into the overall whole
● Technical part and the functional part
● We use technology to solve business problems
● Let's say you have a customer in finance and they have a feature request, how you would you
outline and roadmap it?

4) Customer Focus:
● Ability to think about “impact” on the customer/client
● How to handle difficult customer situations
● How to handle changing requirements, vague requirements, too many requirements
● Sense of urgency/deadline focus
● Quality, quantity, scale, security, creep
● Passion for working with internal customers (Googlers)
● Ability to meet SLAs
● Interest in business process
● Understands that our work involves dimensions of both application maintenance and
operations (keeping services running to agreed SLA’s)
