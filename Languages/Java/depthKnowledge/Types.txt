Primitive Types and Reference Types
  Integral Types : byte short int long char
  Floating types: float double

  For byte, from -128 to 127, inclusive
  For short, from -32768 to 32767, inclusive
  For int, from -2147483648 to 2147483647, inclusive
  For long, from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807, inclusive
  For char, from '\u0000' to '\uffff' inclusive, that is, from 0 to 65535

  widens - Numeric promotion
  if either the operand  is not an int, numeric promotion for 32 bit precision
  if either the operand  is not a long  numeric promotion for 64 bit precision

  boolean can be casted to String
  if while do for - loops expects boolean

  Types:
    Class Type
    Interface Type
    TypeVariable - Annotations
    Array Type

  Heap Pollution

  Object - instance of class or array
    class instance creation expression
    array instance creation expression

  Operations on objects
    Field access - with . operator
    method access - with . operator
    cast operator
    instanceof operator

  Class Object
    clone, equals, finalize, notify, wait, toString, getClass, equals
  Class String
    concatenation operator - +

  Reference type are same if
    compile time type
      part of same class - same interface
    run time type
      same class type, same interface type, loaded by same class loader

Type Arguments
  < ? extends B >
  ? super B

Type information are erased during compilation, and not completely available during run time
type information that are available during run time - reifiable types
Raw Type, primitive , array types
Intersection types
Sub types

Variables - compile time type
