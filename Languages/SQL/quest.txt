1 - UNION and UNION ALL
union - no duplicates
union all - duplicates (more performant, use when you know that there is no duplicates)

2 - joins
inner join - both table matching
left join - return all from left table (even there is no match, for those records it will be shown as null from right)
right join - opposite of left joins

full join - like union, contains everything from left and right
cross join -

3 - where customer id(varchar) <> '123'
will not include customer id which is null

4 - flip Sex= 'm' to Sex = 'f'
select
case
when Sex - 'm'
'f'
when Sex - 'f'
'm'
end
from Table

5 - using union all remove duplicates
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE a=X UNION ALL SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE b=Y AND a!=X

6 - 5 highest value
select TERRITORY_ID from MOT_TERRITORIES where rownum<6  order by TERRITORY_ID desc;

7 -
