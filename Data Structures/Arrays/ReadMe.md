#Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x
* sorting
* Hash
# Majority Element
* moore's voting algorithm
#Find the Number Occurring Odd Number of Times
* XOR all the elements
# Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
* max so far and max ending here (max and current max)
# find  the missing Number
* use formula - n(n+1)/2
* use XOR1 with the number , XOR2 without the number - then XOR1 xor XOR2
#search in a rotated array
* binary search
#Merge an array of size n into another array of size m+n
* move to an end and fill the gap based on larger or not
#Median of two sorted arrays
* count while merging
* median of two medians
#Write a program to reverse an array or string
* use stack
* use recursion
# Program for array rotation
* double reverse (R1, R2 and reverse complete)
